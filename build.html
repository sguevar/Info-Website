                    Building your own computer is a very fun project that you can do on the side. To someone who isnt familiar with computers, this idea seems complicated and very difficult. This is true but when you break down all the parts you need for a computer and learn about each one individually, it will get easier. I watched hundreds of videos and read up on a lot of reviews about parts in order to identify which parts I wanted for my computer. I also wanted almost every part to be white so I could have an all white build.
