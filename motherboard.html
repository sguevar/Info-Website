                <h3 class="p2"> The Motherboard </h3>
                <p class="p2">
                    The motherboard is the main circuit board in a computer. It is what holds everything together, what allows communication between different components and parts. When it comes to comparing a computer and its components to a human body, there can be a lot of similarities on what some parts do to a computer and what a part of a human body does. For instance, a motherboard can be compared to the skeletal system or the circulatory system (Digital Trends). The motherboard can be seen as the circulatory system as it "pumps" power to the rest of the components that is connected to it, similar to how the circulatory system pumps blood to the rest of your body. The motherboard holds all the parts together including the CPU, RAM, GPU, and the Storage device(s). It provides a way for all the parts to communicate with each other to perform neccessary tasks.

                    Without the motherboard, you cannot have a working computer so it is one of the essential parts to a computer. You need to have a motherboard that is good at spreading information and energy across the different components. The power supply is connected to the motherboard in order to power up the CPU and the rest of the parts. Not all motherboards are the same and it is important to make sure to know what the differences between motherboards are. For instance, the only two brands for CPUs for computer are AMD and Intel. The CPUs for each company has a different configuration of pins for the socket where it is inserted into the motherboard. This means that there are motherboards specifically meant to be compatible with AMD CPUs and then there are others meant to be compatible with Intel CPUs. If you have an Intel CPU and you purchase a motherboard meant for AMD CPUs, then you will not be able to use them together.

                    After you know which motherboard you need for the CPU you have, you need to decide on the size of the motherboard you want in your computer. The 3 major form factors of motherboards are ATX, MicroATX, and the Mini-ITX motherboards. The ATX is the biggest and most popular of the three and usually is meant for bigger computers, they usually come with much more slots for GPUs, RAM, and storage. The MicroATX is a bit smaller and is great for people who want a mid-sized computer. They offer less slots but enough for high-end systems. The Mini-ITX are much smaller than the two and are meant for really small and compact computers. You can build a high-end system with a Mini-ITX motherboard but it usually isnt recommended.

                    There are many other factors that you must take into account if you want to choose the right motherboard for the system you want to purchase or build. For example, you have to make sure that the RAM you are using is compatible with the motherboard you are using. If you want to learn more details on what you should know before choosing a motherboard, NewEgg has a great article describing every detail. <a href="https://www.newegg.com/insider/how-to-choose-a-motherboard/">Click Here</a> for the article.
