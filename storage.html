                We just learned about a computers short-term memory, RAM, now we will learn a little bit about its long-term memory. When you save a document, you probably save it in a folder where you can find it later, or if you are like some people you save it and dont pay attention to where it saved and struggle to find it later. If you turn off your computer, that document will still be there waiting for you to open it. 
                This is the long-term memory, or storage, of your computer. This is where you save and download all your applications and documents.

                There are two different types of storage, Hard Drives(HD) and SSD(SD) and each do the same thing but differently. HDs use disks and magnets in order to get your data and they can store a lot of data, much more than most consumers need. Most laptops offer around 0.25 ~ 1 TB of storage total but some HDs can store more than 10 TBs of data. 
                The only problem with HDs are that they are mechanical drives, so they can break and are also much slower at getting data than the other type of storage SSDs. The main advantage of Hds are that they are very affordable compared to SSDs. You can get 2 TBs of storage for around $55 with a HD but the same storage for a SSD could cost you over $200.

                Speaking of SSDs, they are another form of storage you can purchase, which are much more 
                reliable and fast but come with a cost. There are no moving parts
                in a SSD so they are not at risk of breaking like a HD can. When it comes to speed, 
                there is no comparison between the two. The SSD does everything a HD can but much better. 
                If you do not have a SSD in your laptop or computer, then it might take a couple of minutes
                after you turn on your computer for it to finally get to the loading screen. 
                If you feel like you computer is really slow to start up, or slow in general, it might be
                due to a lack of a SSD. To learn more about both storage options, watch the video to the right.
