                    Application Software 
                </h3>
                <p class="p2">
                What exactly falls into the category of application software? Well according to Fingent again, "Application software is a computer program that performs a specific function, be it educational, personal, or business." 
                When you look at the definition, you will see that there
                are tons of programs that fit that description. The 6 
                application softwares that I will talk about include: Web browsers, 
                Spreadsheet Software, Presentation Software, Graphics Software, Multimedia Software, 
                and Word Processors.
                <h3 class="p2"> 
                    a. Web Browsers
                </h3> 
                <p class="p2">
                    How exactly does a web browser fall into the category
                    of application software? Browsers are able to locate 
                    and get information from the World Wide Web (www). 
                    Browsers can be very complex in the back-end, they need to 
                    make sure the user does not experience any issues 
                    regarding a lack of support with JavaScript for example. 
                    Browsers also allow plug-ins for users and require browsers to have support for them as well. 
                    Examples of web browsers are: <b>Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera </b>
                </p>
                <h3 class="p2"> 
                    b. Spreadsheet Software 
                </h3>
                <p class="p2"> 
                    Spreadsheet Softwares store data in tables, each piece of data 
                    are stored in "cells". Users can use and manipulate the cells
                    to do functions with the data. Examples of Spreadsheet Softwares include:<b> Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets</b>
                </p>
                <h3 class="p2"> 
                    c. Presentation Software
                </h3>
                <p class="p2">
                    Another application software that many students are used to using is 
                    the presentation software. The software allows users to 
                    create presentation using slides to input and show information. 
                    They allow you to add text, images and videos to make the presentation more 
                    informative and entertaining. Examples include: <b>Microsoft Powerpoint, Google Slides, and Prezi</b>
                <h3 class="p2"> 
                    d. Graphics Software
                </h3> 
                <p class="p2">
                    This type of software allows users to make changes to videos, and images. 
                    There are some students that take classes that rely on Graphics Software. Images are able 
                    to be manipulated and edited in many ways, there is a video where a picture of a pizza was photoshopped 
                    into a woman, if you want to watch the video you can watch it <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j656_RiO0k">here.</a> Video edits are very common whether it is a Youtube video or a video of a wedding, editing a long video into shorter 
                    highlights is common and necessary at times. This type of software allows these edits to happen, some examples of these applications include: <b>Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop </b>
                </p>
                <h3 class="p2"> 
                    e. Multimedia Software 
                </h3>
                <p class="p2"> 
                    Multimedia includes technology that uses texts, graphics, animation and audio in order to make and deliver
                    information. Because of this, multimedia software must allow the user to record videos, images, or audio. Not all multimedia software is designed to create multimedia but there are others that are meant to play multimedia. Examples of Multimedia Software include: <b>Windows Media Player, VLC, and iTunes</b>
                </p>
                <h3 class="p2"> 
                    f. Word Processors 
                </h3>
                <p class="p2"> 
                    Word Processors allows text to be altered in size and in the font 
                    There is code needed to automaticlly wrap the text in the most efficient way, word processors want 
                    to fill the line with words but also want to make all the text look even. Word processors also include 
                    plug-in-like features like spellcheck and grammar-check. Examples include:<b> Microsoft Word and Google Docs</b>
                </p>
