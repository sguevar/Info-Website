                    Welcome to the Hardware section! Hardware is the physical components of a computer. Hardware is can be a difficult topic to cover as it seems like there is a lot of different parts that look and seem completely different. Although this is a valid reason for people to be mistaken and not aware of what each part does, I want to try and teach the most essential parts that people should be aware of.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's use a car as an example of how to breakdown the parts that make one. A car has an engine, wheels, a battery, a steering wheel, and brakes. Obviously this are not all the parts that make up a car, it also does not include all the parts that are needed to make a car run but most people know what the items I listed are. I did not mention a sparkplug because this is a very small and detailed part that may overwhelm someone if they need to remember this part. I want to avoid overwhelming people with the information I provide so I chose the 6 essential components, with the exception of the graphics card as you dont neccessarily need one for a computer to run. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each part is essential to making a computer work, if one fails then there is a high chance that the computer will not be usable without the issue being addressed. Each of these parts have different models and different companies that produce them which means it is important to know the difference between them as not all parts are compatible with one another. In order to learn more about each individual part, you can click on the image to the right or click on the links on the hardware navigation bar!
