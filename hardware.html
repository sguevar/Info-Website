A computer, or laptop, will have 6 essential component, with the exception
of the graphic card. Each part is essential to making a computer work, 
if one fails then there is a high chance that the computer will not be 
usable without the issue being addressed. Each of these parts have hundreds
of different models and it is important to know the difference between them as 
not all parts are compatible with one another.

            <p class="p2">
                The MotherBoard can often be compared to the skeletal system in a human body. 
                It is the part of a computer where everything comes together and is able to 
                communicate with each other. Without a motherboard, you essentially have useless
                parts. There is no computer without a motherboard. There are ports 
                located everywhere on the motherboard where you can connect the power supply, RAM, GPU, and Storage. 
                The CPU goes in a socket right in the middle of the motherboard. Not all motherboards are 
                created the same, and it is important for you to understand which motherboard you need 
                and which you should buy. For more information regarding motherboards specifically, Click Here!

            <h3 class="p2"> 2. Central Processing Unit (CPU) / Processor </h3>
            <p class="p2">
                The Processor (CPU) of a computer is responsible for listening and 
                sending instructions from other components and to others. The CPU 
                is like the brain of a computer, without one a computer will not 
                function. Similar to a motherboard, you need to have a CPU in order
                to have a working computer but the CPU is seen as more important. 
                One major component people look at to determine the speed and power
                of a computer is the processor that it has. Being able to send instructions
                to the rest of your components at a faster pace will determine how good 
                a computer can run. The only two manufacturers of CPUs for computers 
                are Intel and AMD. To learn more regarding CPUs, Click Here!

            <p class="p2">
                The graphics card is a really important part if you want your computer to 
                run as smooth and fast as possible but it is the only component that is not 
                necessary to have in order for your computer to work, in some cases. The GPU 
                helps take an important and demanding job away from the CPU and the RAM, which
                is to process and display images to the user. The GPU excels at processing 3d images
                and is needed in order to do heavy tasks such as photo editing, video editing, 
                and gaming. If you need to do any of these things, then a GPU would be strongly recommended. 
                There are some processors that have integrated graphics on them so they can run without
                a dedicated GPU. This is a situation where you would not need a GPU but one is still recommended
                to maximize the speed and help the cooling in your system. To learn more about Graphics Cards, Click Here!

                <h3 class="p2"> 4. Random Access Memory (RAM) </h3>
                <p class="p2">
                    Random Access Memory is a crucial part of a computer so that it runs fast and smooth. 
                    In simpler terms, RAM is the short-term memory of a computer rather than the long-term memory such 
                    as a Hard Drive (HD) or a Solid State Drive (SSD). Basically a computer loads different applications
                    and stores them in its short-term memory so that when you use that application, 
                    you can load into it much faster. AN example would be the information you 
                    store when you are browsing the internet, different tabs would be stored into the RAM so that you 
                    can quickly go back without waiting for it to load again. If your computer starts to slow down significantly
                    when you have many tabs open, it is most likely your RAM slowing it down. To learn more about 
                    RAM, Click Here!

            <p class="p2">
                We just learned about a computers short-term memory, RAM, now we will learn a little bit about 
                its long-term memory. When you save a document, you probably save it 
                in a folder where you can find it later, or if you are like some people you save 
                it and dont pay attention to where it saved and struggle to find it later. IF you turn off
                your computer, that document will still be there waiting for you to open it. 
                This is the long-term memory, or storage, of your computer. This is where you save 
                and download all your applications and documents. There are two different
                types of storage, Hard Drives(HD) and SSD(SD) and each do the same
                thing but differently. HDs use disks and magnets in order to get your data and they can store
                a lot of data, much more than most consumers need. Most laptops offer 
                around 0.25 ~ 1 TB of storage total but some HDs can store more than 10 TBs of data. 
                The only problem with HDs are that they are mechanical drives, so they can 
                break and are also much slower at getting data than the other type of storage SSDs. 
                The main advantage of Hds are that they are very affordable compared to SSDs. You can get
                2 TBs of storage for around $55 with a HD but the same storage for a SSD could cost you over $200.
                
                Speaking of SSDs, they are another form of storage you can purchase, which are much more 
                reliable and fast but come with a cost. There are no moving parts
                in a SSD so they are not at risk of breaking like a HD can. When it comes to speed, 
                there is no comparison between the two. The SSD does everything a HD can but much better. 
                If you do not have a SSD in your laptop or computer, then it might take a couple of minutes
                after you turn on your computer for it to finally get to the loading screen. 
                If you feel like you computer is really slow to start up, or slow in general, it might be
                due to a lack of a SSD. To learn more about both storage options, Click Here!

            <h3 class="p2"> 6. Power Supply </h3>
            <p class="p2">
                The Power Supply would be the final part that is absolutely necessary to have a working computer. Laptops are 
                slightly different as the power supply would be the brick you use to charge the battery. 
                The power supply is what gives a computer its power from an outlet, it connects to the motherboard, your Hard Drives, and your GPU. It
                gives power to your entire computer and without it, again you cannot have a working computer. It is 
                important to know how much power, watts, your computer needs in order to function 
                to its best ability. The better and the faster the parts you have, the more power
                you may need. If you have a 450 watt PSU and your computer needs at least
                550, then your computer may crash often since it does not give enough power to your system. 
                The power supply is one of the most important parts but people tend to undervalue it. After spending money on 
                a computer, people sometimes buy a cheap PSU that meets the requirements, this can lead to 
                issues for the rest of the system if you cheap out on a PSU. To learn more about PSUs, Click Here!
