                    This website is for my final project in class INFO-I 310. The goal of this project was to create a website that I had a fun time creating. I enjoy computers, I have had a passion for them all my life so being able to research more about them and including my own knowledge seemed like a fun idea. Being able to mix every part of computers into one project was fun. I combined the software, the coding of the website itself with research of more software, with the hardware. I researched about the hardware as well, different computer parts and also speaking about building computers. The software was the more challenging out of the 3 as I wasnt sure how to exactly break it down so someone who does not know much about how a computer works and what software exactly is.

                    <br>
                    The hardware and the part where I show what is needed in order to build a computer was my favorite part of this project. I know more about the hardware of a computer as I have watched countless videos regarding the different parts when I wanted to build my 2 computers. There are many parts that are needed for a computer to work but I focused on 6 that I believe are the most essential. There are other fans such as fans or other cooling systems that are needed for a computer but I decided not to overwhelm the amount of information I decided to provide. I briefly described each part, what it does and why it is essential for a computer to have.

                    In the build your own computer section, I discuss some of the steps I took in order to build my own computer and some of the parts I recommend to people. I am not an expert in my opinion so I want to make sure people actually research on their own before they make any purchases. Building a computer can get expensive but it is very fun to do, I recommend building a computer rather than purchasing one when it comes to certain situations. To the right is the computer I built last fall, I took months of research and saving in order for me to make up my mind on what parts I wanted to purchase for it.
