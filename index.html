                This website is for my final project in class INFO-I 310. The goal of this project was to create a website that I had a fun time creating. I enjoy computers, I have had a passion for them all my life so being able to research more about them and including my own knowledge seemed like a fun idea. Being able to mix every part of computers into one project was fun. I combined the software, the coding of the website itself with research of more software, with the hardware. I researched about the hardware as well, different computer parts and also speaking about building computers.
