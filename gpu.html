            <p class="p2">
                The graphics card is a really important part if you want your computer to 
                run as smooth and fast as possible but it is the only component that is not 
                necessary to have in order for your computer to work, in some cases. The GPU 
                helps take an important and demanding job away from the CPU and the RAM, which
                is to process and display images to the user. The GPU excels at processing 3d images
                and is needed in order to do heavy tasks such as photo editing, video editing, 
                and gaming. If you need to do any of these things, then a GPU would be strongly recommended. 
                There are some processors that have integrated graphics on them so they can run without
                a dedicated GPU. This is a situation where you would not need a GPU but one is still recommended
                to maximize the speed and help the cooling in your system. To learn more about Graphics Cards, Click Here!
