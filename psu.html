                <p class="p2">
                    The Power Supply would be the final part that is absolutely necessary to have a working computer. Laptops are 
                    slightly different as the power supply would be the brick you use to charge the battery. 
                    The power supply is what gives a computer its power from an outlet, it connects to the motherboard, your Hard Drives, and your GPU. It
                    gives power to your entire computer and without it, again you cannot have a working computer. It is 
                    important to know how much power, watts, your computer needs in order to function 
                    to its best ability. The better and the faster the parts you have, the more power
                    you may need. If you have a 450 watt PSU and your computer needs at least
                    550, then your computer may crash often since it does not give enough power to your system. 
                    The power supply is one of the most important parts but people tend to undervalue it. After spending money on 
                    a computer, people sometimes buy a cheap PSU that meets the requirements, this can lead to 
                    issues for the rest of the system if you cheap out on a PSU. To learn more about PSUs, click on the video!
