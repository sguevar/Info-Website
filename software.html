    A computer, or laptop, will have physical parts but without software, they will be useless parts running with no function. "Software is any computer program that enables you to perform certain specific tasks on your computer"(Fingent).The major types of computer software are application, system, programming, and driver software. Each of the different types of software has its own applications and functions. These are needed in order to make apps run, peripherals like mice and keyboards work, operating systems like Windows run, and also allows coding to run properly.

                1. Application Software 
            </h3>
            <p class="p2">
            What exactly falls into the category of application software? Well according to Fingent again, "Application software is a computer program that performs a specific function, be it educational, personal, or business." 
            When you look at the definition, you will see that there
            are tons of programs that fit that description. The 6 
            application softwares that I will talk about include: Web browsers, 
            Spreadsheet Software, Presentation Software, Graphics Software, Multimedia Software, 
            and Word Processors.
            <h3 class="p2"> Web Browsers</h3> 
            <p class="p2">
                How exactly does a web browser fall into the category
                of application software? Browsers are able to locate 
                and get information from the World Wide Web (www). 
                Browsers can be very complex in the back-end, they need to 
                make sure the user does not experience any issues 
                regarding a lack of support with JavaScript for example. 
                Browsers also allow plug-ins for users and require browsers to have support for them as well. 
                Examples of web browsers are:Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera 
            </p>
            <h3 class="p2"> Spreadsheet Software </h3>
            <p class="p2"> 
                Spreadsheet Softwares store data in tables, each piece of data 
                are stored in "cells". Users can use and manipulate the cells
                to do functions with the data. Examples of Spreadsheet Softwares include: Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets

                Presentation Software
            </h3>
            <p class="p2">
                Another application software that many students are used to using is 
                the presentation software. The software allows users to 
                create presentation using slides to input and show information. 
                They allow you to add text, images and videos to make the presentation more 
                informative and entertaining. Examples include: Microsoft Powerpoint, Google Slides, and Prezi
            <h3 class="p2"> Graphics Software</h3> 
            <p class="p2">
                This type of software allows users to make changes to videos, and images. 
                There are some students that take classes that rely on Graphics Software. Images are able 
                to be manipulated and edited in many ways, there is a video where a picture of a pizza was photoshopped 
                into a woman, if you want to watch the video you can watch it <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j656_RiO0k">here.</a> Video edits are very common whether it is a Youtube video or a video of a wedding, editing a long video into shorter 
                highlights is common and necessary at times. This type of software allows these edits to happen, some examples of these applications include: <b>Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop </b>
            </p>
            <h3 class="p2"> Multimedia Software </h3>
            <p class="p2"> 
                Multimedia includes technology that uses texts, graphics, animation and audio in order to make and deliver
                information. Because of this, multimedia software must allow the user to record videos, images, or audio. Not all multimedia software is designed to create multimedia but there are others that are meant to play multimedia. Examples of Multimedia Software include: Windows Media Player, VLC, and iTunes
            </p>
            <h3 class="p2"> Word Processors </h3>
            <p class="p2"> 
                Word Processors allows text to be altered in size and in the font 
                There is code needed to automaticlly wrap the text in the most efficient way, word processors want 
                to fill the line with words but also want to make all the text look even. Word processors also include 
                plug-in-like features like spellcheck and grammar-check. Examples include: Microsoft Word and Google Docs

                2. System Software 
            </h3>
            <p class="p2">
            System Software is used to control the computer and its applications. Basically, the system software is used to manage the computer and allows applications to run in the background that is needed for the computer to work properly. There are different types of system software but the one I will talk about will be the Operating System. An operating system is the fundamental software that allows any computing device to run, it manages the hardware of a computer and the software as well. It forms a connection that allows both to work as a pair, something very necessary to have a good working computer. Operating Systems must be great at managing your memory, distributing processing power across parts, manage all your files, be secure, and other functions. The 3 most popular operating systems for computers are: Windows, MacOS, and Chrome OS. For phones, Android and IOS reign supreme over the rest of the competition. 
            <h3 class="p2"> Windows</h3> 
            <p class="p2">
                Windows is by far the most popular Operating System in the world when it comes to computers. If you are reading this, there is around a 75% chance you are reading this from a Windows-run computer. Microsoft used to relese a whole new version of Windows every couple of years but have switched over to the more preferred way of constantly updating and evolving one software. Consumers do not want to but a whole new software when one gets outdated, they prefer buying one and updating it when needed. Most people are familiar with Windows and the UI it offers users. Windows is not as safe in terms of security as the other two operating systems mentioned as more people use it so it poises more risk. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="p2"> MacOS </h3>
            <p class="p2"> 
                MacOS is now the third most popular operatring system for computers with a little less than 10% of users using it. Obviously macOS is only available in Apple devices such as the Macbook and iMacs. Apple has also adopted an update-driven operating system that allows users to simply updatre their operating system when new updates are released. MacOs is much safer than Windows as there are fewer users on the system. If someone were to attack either Windows or MacOs, they would be able to affect much more people worldwide with Windows as millions of more people use it. This does not mean MacOs is completely safe from attacks. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="p2"> ChromeOS </h3>
            <p class="p2"> 
                ChromeOS is Googles introduction and way of introducing their own operating system for their devices. We have seen Apple and Microsoft dominate the operating system competition for years without another competitor until Google has stepped up. This is similar to how Samsung and Apple dominate the phone industry and Google is starting to rise in popularity as well. ChromeOs is a Linux-based system, that is used on their Chromebooks. Linux never grew in popularity as an operating system as its own but it is a majot part in how ChromeOs functions.   
            </p>
            <h3 class="p2"> Differences</h3>
            <p class="p2"> 
                Windows is the more popular of the 3, and it is no secret why. They allow companies such as: Dell, Lenovo, Acer, and HP to use their operating system on their products. This means that Windows is readily available for anyone at a very wide range of prices. There are very cheap laptops that use Windows and very expensive PCs that use Windows as well. Windows is also more compatible with hardware and is the operating system choice for gaming computers for that reason. MacOS is made to work on their devices and hardware only, it is not available to everyone worldwide at a range of prices. Apple products are always on the higher end of prices and are seen as a luxury at times, this is another reason it is not as popular. MacOS is very simple and arguably the best feature is its compatibility with its "Apple eco-system". ChromeOS are usually used in cheaper devices out of the three and uses a more web-browser approach. Since it uses a web-browser approach, cheaper parts are able to run the software much more easily which is suitable for users with less money.
