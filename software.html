    A computer, or laptop, will have physical parts but without software, they will be useless parts running with no function. "Software is any computer program that enables you to perform certain specific tasks on your computer"(Fingent).The major types of computer software are application, system, programming, and driver software. Each of the different types of software has its own applications and functions. These are needed in order to make apps run, peripherals like mice and keyboards work, operating systems like Windows run, and also allows coding to run properly.
